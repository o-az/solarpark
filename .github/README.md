[Solar](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/solar) is a new Solidity compiler written in Rust. It aims to solve all the pain points of `solc` and `solc-js`. It's WASM-friendly which means it's light work to get it up in the browser.

[solarpark] tracks Solar releases and provides instant access and experimentation for every new release. It automatically redeploys when `main` branch in the Solar repository is updated.
