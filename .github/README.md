[Solar](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/solar) is a new Solidity compiler written
in Rust. It aims to solve all the pain points of `solc` and `solc-js`. It's
WASM-friendly which means it's light work to get it up in the browser.

[solarpark] tracks Solar releases and provides instant access and
experimentation for every new release. It automatically redeploys when `main`
branch in the Solar repository is updated.
