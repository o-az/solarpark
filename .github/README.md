[Solar](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/solar) is a new Solidity compiler written in Rust. It aims to solve all the pain points of `solc` and `solc-js`. It's WASM-friendly which means it's light work to get it up in the browser.

The goal of this project is to track Solar releases and provide instant access and experimentation for every new release.
Solarpark automatically redeploys when `main` branch in the Solar repository is updated.
